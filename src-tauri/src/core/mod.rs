//! The OSC/audio domain — no HTTP (that's [`crate::router`]).
//!
//! * [`osc`] — generic OSC helpers (encode/decode/peek), shared by all peers.
//! * [`peer`] — a connected UDP backend + address-routing primitives.
//! * [`bridge`] — a generic OSC switch: routes outbound packets to peers by
//!   address and fans inbound datagrams out to subscribers. Protocol-agnostic.
//! * [`scsynth`] — the scsynth protocol + a supervisor (register / poll
//!   `/status` / reconnect / unregister), plus the node-id partitioning scheme
//!   and group messaging, on top of a [`bridge::Bridge`].
//! * [`sessions`] — per-client session store: node-id sub-block allocation +
//!   liveness bookkeeping (the data structure; the reaper that drives eviction
//!   lives in [`crate::server`]).
