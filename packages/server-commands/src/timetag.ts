/**
 * Timetag helpers for scheduling OSC bundles against scsynth's
 * sample-accurate queue.
 *
 * scsynth reads the 64-bit NTP timetag off every bundle; if it's in
 * the future the bundle sits in a priority queue and fires at exactly
 * that audio sample. `osc-js` converts between JS timestamps
 * (ms since the Unix epoch) and NTP for us, so `Bundle`'s timetag
 * argument just wants a JS ms value. This module provides ergonomic
 * constructors for the common cases.
 */

/** JS timestamp (ms since Unix epoch) accepted by `new OSC.Bundle(t, …)`.
 *
 *  IMPORTANT: must be an **integer**. osc-js's Bundle constructor checks
 *  `isInt(arg)` for the timetag and silently falls back to `Date.now()`
 *  if the value is fractional (`node_modules/osc-js/lib/osc.js`,
 *  line 850). All helpers in this module round their result to an
 *  integer; callers that compute their own timetag must do the same. */
